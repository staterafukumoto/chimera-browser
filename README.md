# Chimera Web Browser (work in progress)

## How to build
1. Listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDpmVUEjagg) in the background (always do this when building or compiling)
2. [Download and install NodeJS onto your computer's disk](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Open the repository folder into your OS's terminal (usually via the `cd` command)
4. Run the command `npm i` or `npm install` to make sure you've downloaded all the dependencies
5. Run with `npm start` to make sure it works correctly on your OS (has been tested working on windows 10 x64 and manjaro i3)
6. Run the correct build script to compile it for your operating system (see *Supported Platforms and Build Scripts*)
7. Pray to whatever god you worship that it compiles.
